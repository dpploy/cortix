What is Cortix?
---------------

-  Cortix is a Python library for system-level module coupling,
   execution, and
   analysis.
-  Cortix takes as input a collection of computational modules and
   provides an
   environment for the coupling of those modules into a single
   simulation.
-  Cortix handles:

   -  Communication between the modules
   -  Numerical integration
   -  Data visualization

The basic concepts in Cortix are the creation of an ``Application`` and
a ``Simulation`` involving ``Tasks``.

Usage
-----

Cortix is a library and it is best used when copied to its own
directory, say inside a project directory of your choice, *e.g.*,
``/somepath/myproject/cortix/``, or anywhere else in your system,
*e.g.*, ``/somepath/cortix``. Then add either
``/somepath/myproject to $PYTHONPATH`` or ``/somepath to $PYTHONPATH``,
respectively.

Cortix has a directory (``examples/``) that contains examples for input
files, and a driver file. At the moment these input files are past files
used in the development of Cortix. A driver file is needed to run
Cortix. There is an example (``examples/driver-cortix.py``) that can be
copied to say:
``/somepath/driver-test.py or /somepath/myproject/driver-test.py``. An
input configuration (xml) file is also needed. An example is provided in
the ``examples/input/`` directory (cortix-config.xml). Then to run
Cortix, enter the directory of the driver and run the driver
``./driver-test.py`` which will run an MPI process for Cortix and an
additional MPI process for each launched module as a single MPI process
or as a pool of processes. To capture the Cortix screen output of log
messages (and other standard output messages), issue the bash command
``/driver-cortix.py >& screen.out`` under Linux (inspect the output file
``screen.out`` when the run is finished). Extensive logging of runtime
information is stored in the ``<work_dir>`` directory specified in the
``cortix-config.xml`` input file.

Testing
-------

Testing is facilitated through PyTest. To execute the tests, run the
``py.test`` command from the tests directory.

Linux
-----

Most Linux distros will provide an evironment with the needed
dependencies.

Mac OS X
